# Sustainability Communications Framework
*A strategic approach to translating complex sustainability compliance into actionable seller communications*

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a systematic approach to developing effective communications for sustainability compliance requirements, specifically designed for e-commerce marketplaces and selling partner ecosystems.

**Problem Statement**: Sustainability regulations like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) create complex compliance requirements that need to be communicated clearly to diverse, global seller communities.

**Solution**: A framework combining content strategy, stakeholder analysis, and automated content optimization to create scalable, personalized communications.

## Core Modules

### 1. Content Analyzer (`content_analyzer.py`)
- **Complexity Scoring**: Analyzes regulatory text for reading level, technical density
- **Key Concept Extraction**: Identifies critical compliance points requiring emphasis
- **Translation Readiness**: Flags content requiring localization considerations

### 2. Stakeholder Mapper (`stakeholder_mapper.py`)
- **Seller Segmentation**: Creates personas based on business size, category, experience level
- **Communication Preferences**: Maps preferred channels and content formats per segment
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies high-risk sellers requiring priority communication

### 3. Message Optimizer (`message_optimizer.py`)
- **Content Adaptation**: Tailors message complexity and format to audience segment
- **Channel Optimization**: Adapts content for different communication channels
- **Personalization Engine**: Creates targeted messaging based on seller profile

### 4. Compliance Tracker (`compliance_tracker.py`)
- **Regulation Monitoring**: Tracks changes in sustainability regulations across EU markets
- **Impact Analysis**: Assesses which seller segments are affected by new requirements
- **Alert Prioritization**: Creates tiered communication urgency levels

## Strategic Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
1. **Regulatory Landscape Mapping**
   - Identify current and upcoming sustainability requirements
   - Map regulatory complexity and seller impact
   - Create compliance timeline and milestone tracking

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Segment seller base by compliance readiness and business characteristics  
   - Identify communication preferences and channel effectiveness
   - Map seller journey from awareness to compliance

### Phase 2: Content Strategy Development
1. **Message Architecture**
   - Core value proposition for compliance participation
   - Tiered messaging for different complexity levels
   - Cross-cultural adaptation guidelines

2. **Channel Strategy**
   - Omnichannel approach optimized for seller preferences
   - Crisis communication escalation protocols
   - Feedback loop integration for continuous improvement

### Phase 3: Implementation & Optimization
1. **Campaign Development**
   - Personalized communication sequences
   - A/B testing framework for message effectiveness
   - Performance tracking and sentiment analysis

2. **Scale Management**
   - Automated content generation for routine communications
   - Human oversight protocols for complex or sensitive situations
   - Integration with existing seller support systems

## Key Innovation Features

### AI-Assisted Content Creation
- **Regulatory Text Simplification**: Automatic translation of complex legal language
- **Multilingual Optimization**: Culture-aware content adaptation
- **Dynamic Personalization**: Real-time message customization based on seller behavior

### Predictive Communication Planning

- **Rapid Response Templates**: Pre-approved messaging for common scenarios
- **Stakeholder Coordination**: Cross-functional team communication frameworks

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### Awareness Metrics
- **Reach**: Number of sellers receiving communications
- **Engagement**: Open rates, click-through rates, content interaction
- **Comprehension**: Survey scores on regulatory understanding

### Action Metrics  
- **Compliance Adoption**: Percentage of sellers taking required actions
- **Timeline Performance**: Seller compliance vs. regulatory deadlines
- **Support Reduction**: Decrease in compliance-related support tickets

### Experience Metrics
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Seller feedback on communication quality
