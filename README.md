# Sustainability Communications Framework
*A strategic approach to translating complex sustainability compliance into actionable seller communications*

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a systematic approach to developing effective communications for sustainability compliance requirements, specifically designed for e-commerce marketplaces and selling partner ecosystems.

**Problem Statement**: Sustainability regulations like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) create complex compliance requirements that need to be communicated clearly to diverse, global seller communities.

**Solution**: A framework that combines content strategy, stakeholder analysis, and automated content optimisation to create scalable, personalised communications.

```
## Course Learning Integration

As of February 17, 2026, this repository is being enhanced through an official INAEM Environmental Management course (CEOE Aragón, 430 hours).

**Learning documentation**: See [`COURSE_PROGRESS.md`](./COURSE_PROGRESS.md) for timeline and [`learning/`](./learning/) for detailed course notes and applied improvements to the framework.

**Goal**: Transform course knowledge into stronger, more technically-grounded sustainability communications solutions.

## Core Modules

### 1. Content Analyser (`content_analyzer.py`)
- **Complexity Scoring**: Analyses regulatory text for reading level, technical density
- **Key Concept Extraction**: Identifies critical compliance points requiring emphasis
- **Translation Readiness**: Flags content requiring localization considerations

### 2. Stakeholder Mapper (`stakeholder_mapper.py`)
- **Seller Segmentation**: Creates personas based on business size, category, experience level
- **Communication Preferences**: Maps preferred channels and content formats per segment
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies high-risk sellers requiring priority communication

### 3. Message Optimiser (`message_optimizer.py`)
- **Content Adaptation**: Tailors message complexity and format to the audience segment
- **Channel Optimisation**: Adapts content for different communication channels
- **Personalisation Engine**: Creates targeted messaging based on seller profile

### 4. Compliance Tracker (`compliance_tracker.py`)
- **Regulation Monitoring**: Tracks changes in sustainability regulations across EU markets
- **Impact Analysis**: Assesses which seller segments are affected by new requirements
- **Alert Prioritization**: Creates tiered communication urgency levels

## Strategic Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
1. **Regulatory Landscape Mapping**
   - Identify current and upcoming sustainability requirements
   - Map regulatory complexity and seller impact
   - Create a compliance timeline and milestone tracking

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Segment seller base by compliance readiness and business characteristics  
   - Identify communication preferences and channel effectiveness
   - Map seller journey from awareness to compliance

### Phase 2: Content Strategy Development
1. **Message Architecture**
   - Core value proposition for compliance participation
   - Tiered messaging for different complexity levels
   - Cross-cultural adaptation guidelines

2. **Channel Strategy**
   - Omnichannel approach optimised for seller preferences
   - Crisis communication escalation protocols
   - Feedback loop integration for continuous improvement

### Phase 3: Implementation & Optimisation
