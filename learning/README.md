# Learning & Course Documentation

## INAEM Environmental Management Course (Feb 17 - Jun 18, 2026)

This directory documents the learning journey through the official CEOE/INAEM environmental management course and how each module informs and strengthens the **Sustainability Communications Framework**.

### Structure

#### `/modules/`
Detailed notes from each course module covering:
- **MF1971_3**: Normative and internal organisational policies (50h)
- **MF1972_3**: Environmental aspects of the organisation (180h)
- **MF1973_3**: Environmental management systems (150h)
- **MF1974_3**: Prevention of environmental risks (40h)

Each module file captures:
- Key concepts and definitions
- Regulatory requirements
- Real-world applications
- Questions and clarifications needed

#### `/applied_learnings/`
The critical bridge: How each module improves the Sustainability Communications Framework:
- **content_analyzer_improvements.md** → What we learned about environmental terminology depth
- **stakeholder_insights.md** → How to better segment audiences based on environmental maturity
- **regulatory_depth.md** → Understanding what makes regulations complex and how to simplify them

#### `/work_in_progress/`
Raw learning notes, daily reflections, quick ideas, and questions—not polished, but captured for later synthesis.

### Methodology

**Weekly workflow:**
1. **During course** (9:00-14:30): Attend classes, take raw notes
2. **Same day/evening**: Process notes → Module file
3. **Weekly**: Synthesise → Applied learnings → Update framework code if needed
4. **Git commits**: Regular pushes showing ongoing learning integration

### Expected Outcomes

By course completion (June 18, 2026):
- Comprehensive environmental management knowledge foundation
- Enhanced framework modules with regulatory accuracy
- Documented case studies showing framework application to real scenarios
- Final course project integrated with framework improvements, if required. Otherwise, this integration will act as such.
- Portfolio piece demonstrating "learning → application → innovation"

### Progress Tracking

See `../COURSE_PROGRESS.md` for timeline and milestone tracking.

**Objective**: Transform course knowledge into stronger, more credible communications solutions.

**Principle**: Every learning directly improves the framework—no isolated knowledge.
