## Learning Objectives for the Framework

### Primary Goals
1. **Develop technical credibility** in environmental management terminology and concepts
2. **Understand regulatory complexity** from the inside—not just analyzing regulations, but understanding why they exist and what they require
3. **Identify communication pain points** in environmental compliance from a real practitioner perspective
4. **Strengthen framework modules** with authentic, technically-grounded insights

### Secondary Goals
1. Build professional network in environmental management sector
2. Gain official certification to enhance professional positioning
3. Develop case studies demonstrating framework application to real scenarios
4. Create final course project integrated with framework

## Expected Improvements to Framework

### Content Analyser (`src/content_analyzer.py`)
- Better identification of "genuine complexity" vs. "poorly written"
- Deeper understanding of environmental jargon and technical depth
- Improved scoring of what makes regulatory text difficult for different audiences

### Stakeholder Mapper (`src/stakeholder_mapper.py`)
- Segmentation based on environmental maturity level (beginner to expert)
- Understanding different seller/organization pain points at each level
- Better persona development based on real organizational archetypes

### Message Optimiser (`src/message_optimizer.py`)
- Culturally and contextually appropriate messaging for different environmental standards
- Better templates for compliance communication across different regulatory contexts
- Improved personalization based on organizational environmental readiness

### Compliance Tracker (`src/compliance_tracker.py`)
- Deeper understanding of which regulatory changes actually matter to different organizations
- Better prioritization of what needs communication vs. what's standard/expected
- Improved alert systems based on real regulatory impact

## Integration Strategy

**Weekly cycle:**
- **Class time (9:00-14:30)**: Attend, take notes, ask questions
- **Afternoon (14:30+)**: Process learnings, update framework documentation
- **Evening**: Code improvements or applied learnings synthesis
- **Weekly commit**: Push learning progress and any framework updates

**Monthly milestones:**
- Feb 24: Initial synthesis of normative landscape
- Mar 24: Environmental aspects deep dive complete
- Apr 24: SGA systems understanding + first applied learning docs
- May 24: Risk prevention + full applied learnings synthesis
- Jun 18: Final project delivery + complete framework documentation

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All module notes documented in `/learning/modules/`
- ✅ Applied learnings integrated into framework code or documentation
- ✅ At least 2-3 commits per week showing learning integration
- ✅ Final course project demonstrates framework application
- ✅ GitHub repository shows credible, substantive learning journey
- ✅ Portfolio-ready case studies extracted from course project work

## Notes

This course is not just about certification—it's about building authentic expertise that makes the framework credible and effective. The goal is that by June, when someone reviews the repository, they see not just a good idea, but a well-founded solution grounded in real environmental management knowledge.
